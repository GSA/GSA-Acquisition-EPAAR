CSAs are common in information technology acquisitions, including acquisitions of commercial computer software and commercial technical data, and they may apply to any supply or service. CSAs may apply regardless of the format or style of the document (for example, a CSA may be styled as <em class="ph i">standard terms of sale or lease, Terms of Service</em> (TOS), <em class="ph i">End User License Agreement</em> (EULA), or another similar legal instrument or agreement, and may be presented as part of a proposal or quotation responding to a solicitation for a contract or order). CSAs may also apply regardless of the media or delivery mechanism used (for example, a CSA may be presented as one or more paper documents, or may appear on a computer or other electronic device screen during a purchase, software installation, product delivery, registration for a service, or other transaction).
