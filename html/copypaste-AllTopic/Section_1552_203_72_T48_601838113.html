This includes any communication or representation of knowledge, such as facts or data, in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual forms. This definition includes information that an agency disseminates from a web page but does not include the provision of hyperlinks on a web page to information that others disseminate.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(vi) Ensure scientific findings are generated and disseminated in a timely and transparent manner, including scientific research performed by subcontractors and consultants who assist with developing or applying the results of scientific activities;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(vii) Include an explication of underlying assumptions, accurate contextualization of uncertainties, and a description of the probabilities associated with both optimistic and pessimistic projections when communicating scientific findings, if applicable;

If the actual or suspected loss of scientific integrity is by an EPA employee, the Contractor may inform the Agency's Scientific Integrity Official, in addition to the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer's Representative. The Contractor must ensure that its employees are aware of their responsibility to immediately report any actual or suspected loss of scientific integrity to the Contractor, who must communicate it to the EPA in writing. The Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Representative must consult with the Agency's Scientific Integrity Official on all issues related to an actual or suspected loss of scientific integrity under this contract and with the EPA Office of Inspector General (OIG), in accordance with EPA Order 3120.5 <em class="ph i">Policy and Procedures for Addressing Research Misconduct,</em> on all issues related to research misconduct. The Agency's Scientific Integrity Official and/or OIG must advise the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer's Representative on the appropriate remedy for any actual or suspected loss of scientific integrity. The Contractor bears the primary responsibility for prevention and detection of research misconduct and for the inquiry, investigation, and adjudication of research misconduct alleged to have occurred under the contract in association with its own institution. However, the EPA retains the ultimate oversight authority for the EPA-supported research. The Contractor must take the actions required as described in EPA Order 3120.5 <em class="ph i">Policy and Procedures for Addressing Research Misconduct</em> when research misconduct is suspected or found under its contract.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Remedies.</em> The Contracting Officer in consultation with the Scientific Integrity Official and OIG, if applicable, will make the final determination on any remedy to an actual or suspected loss of scientific integrity. Potential remedies include:

                                 <p class="p List2">(2) Acceptance of an alternate mitigation plan negotiated by the parties listed in the first paragraph of this section;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) Termination for convenience, in whole or in part, if no mitigation plan will adequately resolve the actual or suspected loss of scientific integrity; or
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) Termination for default or cause, in whole or in part, if the Contractor was aware of an actual or suspected loss of scientific integrity under this contract and did not disclose it or misrepresented relevant information to the EPA. Additionally, the Government may debar or suspend the Contractor from Government contracting or pursue other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(5) <em class="ph i">Opportunity to Respond</em> - If the party who has been accused of a loss of scientific integrity feels that the Agency has reached an incorrect conclusion or the Contracting Officer has applied an inappropriate remedy, the party may provide a written response to the Contracting Officer, Scientific Integrity Official, and/or OIG.
